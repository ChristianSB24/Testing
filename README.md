# Twitter Clone 
In this project I created a twitter clone using Django to deliver the functionality and React and Bootstrap for a sleek user interface. 
React was rendered via Django. 

Additionally, this project was deployed onto Heroku for easy-access for anyone that wants to test it. It can be found here https://infinite-escarpment-77268.herokuapp.com/
